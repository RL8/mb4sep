# Technical Implementation Roadmap - Indie MVP Focus

## Overview
Essential technical practices for building a production-ready Music Besties MVP, focused on core functionality without overengineering.

## Essential Dependencies

### **Core Infrastructure**
```bash
npm install react-error-boundary @tanstack/react-query zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers next-auth web-vitals next-seo @sentry/nextjs
```

### **UI/UX Essentials**
```bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core focus-trap-react
```

### **Testing Infrastructure**
```bash
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest jest-environment-jsdom @playwright/test @axe-core/react
```

### **Optional (if Premium features in MVP)**
```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-js csv-writer
```

## Implementation Checklist

### **Error Handling & Resilience**
- [ ] Add `react-error-boundary` to app layout
- [ ] Create fallback UI components for errors
- [ ] Add error logging with `@sentry/nextjs`
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### **Form Validation & State Management**
- [ ] Set up `zod` schemas for all forms
- [ ] Integrate `react-hook-form` with `@hookform/resolvers`
- [ ] Use `@tanstack/react-query` for server state
- [ ] Test form validation and submission

### **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
- [ ] Use `next/image` for all images
- [ ] Add `web-vitals` monitoring
- [ ] Test performance with Lighthouse

### **Authentication (if needed)**
- [ ] Set up `next-auth` with email/password or single OAuth provider
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Test authentication flows

### **Accessibility**
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation with `focus-trap-react`
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Run `@axe-core/react` tests

### **Testing**
- [ ] Set up Jest with React Testing Library
- [ ] Create 1-2 Playwright E2E tests for core user journeys
- [ ] Add accessibility tests with `@axe-core/react`
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop functionality with `@dnd-kit/core`

### **Payments (if Premium in MVP)**
- [ ] Integrate `@stripe/stripe-js` for payment processing
- [ ] Add feature gating for premium features
- [ ] Test payment flows
- [ ] Add basic data export with `csv-writer`

## Success Metrics

### **Technical Quality**
- [ ] Zero critical errors in production
- [ ] <3s page load times
- [ ] 90%+ accessibility score
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage for critical paths

### **User Experience**
- [ ] All forms validate correctly
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works smoothly
- [ ] Authentication flows work reliably
- [ ] Mobile experience is optimized
