# Music Besties: App Specification

This document outlines the user flow and functional requirements for the "Music Besties" mobile web application. The core focus of this app is to serve as a high-brow research tool for music superfans, providing a deep dive into an artist's discography and related musical data. The design principles of **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) and **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) will be applied throughout the development to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

## 1. Homepage

**Purpose:** To serve as a simple, single-page entry point to the app.

**Design:** A clean, non-scrolling, single-page layout.

**Content:**
- **App Name:** "Music Besties"
- **Description:** A concise tagline, such as "The app for superfans to create, curate, and connect."
- **Artist Section:** A dedicated section titled "Current Artist" with the name "Taylor Swift" and a button to proceed to her page.
- **"Add Your Own Artist" Button:** A prominent button allowing users to request a new artist.
- **Floating Action Button (FAB):** A floating button that appears on all pages, serving as a help button and a menu.

## 2. "Add Your Own Artist" Page

**Purpose:** To collect user requests for new artists to be added to the platform.

**User Flow:**
1. User clicks "Add Your Own Artist" from the Homepage.
2. The page displays a brief explanation of the feature.
3. A simple form is presented with fields for the artist's name and an optional comment.
4. Clicking the "Submit" button triggers a floating message confirming the submission.
5. The user is then automatically redirected back to the Homepage.

## 3. Taylor Swift Artist Page

**Purpose:** To serve as a dedicated landing page for a specific artist, in this case, Taylor Swift.

**Design:** A single-page layout with no scrolling. A back arrow in the top-left corner allows navigation back to the Homepage.

**Content:**
- A simple "Welcome!" greeting.
- A featured, clickable section for the new album "Life of a Showgirl" with a countdown timer counting down to October 3, 2025, 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (USA). This section serves as a direct shortcut to the Showgirl Countdown activities, specifically the prediction activity where users can predict where "Life of a Showgirl" will rank in their personal album rankings.
- A clear path to the main discography view.

## 4. Discography Page (The Core Experience)

**Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive and interactive view of the artist's discography as a research tool.

**Design:**
- **Persistent 12-Grid View:** The main view of this page is a static grid of 12 albums, representing Taylor Swift's complete discography. This grid remains visible at all times.
- Each album tile displays its respective color, album name, year of release, and number of songs. No album art is used.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar:** A sticky bottom navigation bar provides a mechanism for filtering the data displayed on the album grids. It contains three main tabs:
  - "Explore"
  - "Rank"
  - "Connect"

### 4.1 The "Explore" Tab

**Functionality:** This tab provides access to the research and discovery features of the discography.

**User Flow:**
- **Layer 1:** User taps the "Explore" tab.
- **Layer 2:** A sub-navigation bar appears with three research categories:
  - "Co-writers"
  - "Lyrics" 
  - "Audio"

#### 4.1.1 The "Co-writers" Sub-Tab

**Functionality:** This sub-tab acts as a filter to view albums based on individual songwriter contributions.

**User Flow:**
- **Layer 1:** User taps the "Co-writers" sub-tab.
- **Layer 2:** A sub-navigation bar appears with a list of songwriter names, ordered by total song contributions (highest to lowest), displaying both name and total count (e.g., "Jack Antonoff (45)", "Aaron Dessner (32)", "Max Martin (18)").
- **Drill-Down:** Tapping on a songwriter name displays the number of songs that songwriter worked on for each of the 12 album grids.
- **Further Drill-Down:** Tapping on an album displays a song list showing which specific songs that songwriter worked on.

#### 4.1.2 The "Lyrics" Sub-Tab

**Functionality:** This sub-tab acts as a filter to view albums based on lyrical characteristics.

**User Flow:**
- **Layer 1:** User taps the "Lyrics" sub-tab.
- **Layer 2:** An additional sub-navigation bar appears, listing lyrical characteristics (e.g., word count, lyrical complexity, etc.).
- **Drill-Down:** Tapping a specific lyrical characteristic reveals a numerical value for that characteristic on each of the 12 album grids.
- **Further Drill-Down:** Tapping on an album displays a song list where each song shows the corresponding numerical value for that lyrical characteristic.

#### 4.1.3 The "Audio" Sub-Tab

**Functionality:** This sub-tab acts as a filter to view albums based on their audio features.

**User Flow:**
- **Layer 1:** User taps the "Audio" sub-tab.
- **Layer 2:** A sub-navigation bar appears with a list of audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, acousticness).
- **Drill-Down:** Tapping on an audio feature displays the numerical value for that feature on each of the 12 album grids.
- **Further Drill-Down:** Tapping on an album displays a song list where each song shows the corresponding numerical value for that audio feature.

### 4.2 The "Rank" Tab

**Functionality:** This tab provides access to personal ranking and prediction features.

**User Flow:**

  - "Eras Tour Reunion"
  - "The Travis Era"
  - "Arcade"
  - "Mix and Mingle"

## 5. Implementation Principles

- **Hierarchy of Tabs:** The app will use a clear hierarchy of tabs and views: Main Tabs → List of Characteristics → 12-Album Grid → Song List.
- **Reusability:** Common components for the 12-grid, list items, and navigation will be created to follow the DRY principle.
- **Simplicity:** The core design remains simple (KISS principle), with additional information revealed only when actively requested by the user.
- **Persistence:** The bottom navigation bar and floating action button will be persistent across all screens to maintain a consistent user experience.
