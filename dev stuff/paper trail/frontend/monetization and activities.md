# **Project Plan: Launch day Sprint**

## **1\. Monetization Strategy**

A strategy for monetizing the app, outlining a tiered freemium model with premium features and special promotional offers to drive user engagement and purchases.

### **1.1 Freemium Model**

* We will restrict some functionality and place it behind a paywall. Free users will be able to rank only their top three albums and top three songs within those albums, with a hard cap at the top 13 songs in a discography.

### **1.2 Premium Access**

* We need a clear button in the app header for users to start the purchase process. Premium members will get:  
  * Unlimited album and song rankings.  
  * Early access to new features and activities.  
  * The ability to view other users' preferences and details.  
  * The opportunity to contribute to the community by voting on new features and making suggestions.

### **1.3 Special Offers**

* To launch the premium model, we will offer a limited-time, lifetime subscription to the first **1,989** users. This number should be displayed on the app and decrease as people sign up to create a sense of urgency.

### **1.4 Pricing**

* We will use an anchor price of **$4.89 per month**. The special offers will be:  
  * **The Showgirl Special:** A reduced price of **$10.03** per year to celebrate the upcoming album, *Life of a Showgirl*.  
  * **The Engagement Special:** A one-time offer for a **lifetime** subscription, in celebration of the engagement.

## **2\. Fan Engagement Activities**

This section outlines various fan engagement activities organized into specific categories to create a sense of community and keep users engaged with the app.

### **2.1 Showgirl Countdown**

A collection of activities focused on the upcoming album, *Life of a Showgirl*, designed to build excitement and allow fans to predict and interact with its release.

* **2.1.1 Prediction Activity \[active\]**  
* This is the current activity we have been working on. Use current music rankings to predict where LOAS will feature on your rankings. Once the user has received their prediction, they can mark it as "sounds about right" or "totally way off". Then, once the actual album is released, the user can declare whether or not the prediction was accurate. So anytime they try and access the game afterwards it will be in a state of readiness for the actual result coming out.  
*   
* **2.1.2 The guessing game {with prizes} \[coming soon\]**  
* This is a fan engagement activity where users can guess the official single from the upcoming album. The feature should also allow them to guess if a music video will be released alongside it. Once the album is officially released, the app will announce the winners. We will implement a system to award a special in-app badge to the winners, and we are also exploring options for a real-world prize. This fan engagement activity allows users to predict various aspects of an upcoming album and its releases. This could include guessing the official lead single, anticipating whether a music video will accompany it, speculating on the themes of individual songs, and predicting which other tracks will receive music videos. Upon the album's official release, the app will reveal the winners, who will be awarded a special in-app badge. We are also exploring possibilities for a real-world prize.  
*   
* **2.1.3 Plan the World's Biggest Listen Party \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]**  
* The goal of this activity is to help fans organize a massive, global listening party on the official album release date. The app should provide a dedicated space for this, potentially including a live countdown timer and tools to help users coordinate and participate in the event.  
* 

### **2.2 Eras Tour Reunion**

This category is dedicated to verified attendees of The Eras Tour, offering features to help them connect, share memories, and organize both virtual and in-person meetups.

* 2.2.1 Authenticate Alumni \[coming soon\]  
  To create a trusted community, this activity requires users to authenticate that they are legitimate alumni of The Eras Tour. The app should provide a way for users to submit proof of attendance, such as a photo of their ticket or themselves at the stadium. This information will then be used to verify their status.  
* 2.2.2 Virtual Reunion Parties \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]  
  This feature is designed to connect people who attended the same specific stadium concert. The app should create a private, online space for these groups to reconnect and share their memories and experiences from that specific show.  
* 2.2.3 In-Person Meetups \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]  
  This activity will help verified alumni organize and attend real-world meetups. Unlike the virtual party, these meetups are not restricted to people from the same stadium. The app should provide tools for users to create and promote local meetups in their area for anyone who has been authenticated as a tour attendee.

### **2.3 The Travis Era**

A placeholder category for brainstorming activities related to the ongoing public attention around the relationship with Travis.

* 2.3.1 Engagement shenanigans \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]  
  This is a community-driven feature for fans to collaboratively decide on the most entertaining and creative ways to celebrate the engagement. It's a blank canvas\! What kind of games, challenges, or fan-led projects would you like to create? For example, you could propose a fan-made video compilation of the most iconic moments, a "guess the next public appearance" contest, or even a collaborative digital scrapbook. It's up to the community to decide what this feature will be\!  
* 2.3.2 Wedding shenanigans \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]  
  This is a collaborative space for the community to brainstorm and design a hypothetical wedding for the couple. We want your ideas\! What would the theme be? What songs should be on the playlist? What would the wedding cake look like? It's all up to you to decide and vote on the best ideas\!

### **2.4 Arcade**

A section for fun, interactive mini-games and quizzes for fans, designed to test their knowledge and provide lighthearted entertainment.

* 2.4.1 Do you even Swift, tho?\! \[coming soon\]  
  This is a quiz-style game where users can test their knowledge on song lyrics, music videos, and fun facts about the artist.  
* 2.4.2 \[Community Mini-Games\] \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]  
  This is a space for the community to design and propose new mini-games for the app. What kind of games would you like to play? Maybe it's a rhythm-based game where you have to match button presses to the beat of popular songs, a 'find the easter egg' challenge in virtual recreations of music videos, or even a fast-paced trivia game. It's up to you to decide what comes to the arcade next\!

### **2.5 Mix and Mingle**

A social category aimed at connecting fans with each other through various community-building activities and events.

* 2.5.1 \[Interactive Map\] \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]  
  This will be an interactive map feature where users can see and connect with other fans in their local area, fostering real-world friendships and meetups. We are also open to other ideas\! What other tools or activities would you like to see to help fans connect? Maybe it's a virtual "fan cafe" where you can join a video chat, or a feature to create and share local meetup events. The community will decide what kind of social features we build here.  
* 2.5.2 \[Eras Tour Alumni Initiative\] \[still brainstorming… Help\!\]  
  This is a blank canvas for verified Eras Tour alumni to collectively decide on a new group activity for their specific tour date. We're open to all ideas\!

The possibilities are endless, and we want you to shape what this space becomes\!
