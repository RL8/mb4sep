### Backend Infrastructure

#### GitHub
- [ ] Check that the remote repo is set up and working
- [ ] Check the relevant scripts related to it are also working
- [ ] Make sure we have access to both github cli and api within this app

#### Vercel
- [ ] Vercel CLI connection should be working and accessible
- [ ] Make sure the auto deploy is set up and connected properly
- [ ] Credentials - make sure this one has all the credentials it needs

#### Supabase
- [ ] The retrieval of information from the database seems to be working but make sure you're accessing all the tables by being able to display them on the supabase test page
- [ ] Confirm the correct album colours are recorded in this database
- [ ] Make sure the current app can actually make posts into the database
- [ ] We also need to think about the setup with user authentication
- [ ] **NEW**: Set up database schema for songwriter data (co-writers, lyrics, audio features)
- [ ] **NEW**: Create tables for community activities (Showgirl Countdown, Eras Tour, etc.)

#### Square Payments
- [ ] Connect to private square MCP server and test that the basic functionality works as expected
- [ ] **NEW**: Implement freemium model payment flows
- [ ] **NEW**: Set up special offers (Showgirl Special, Engagement Special)
